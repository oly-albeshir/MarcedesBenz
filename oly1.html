     *The diffrence between xhtml and html also their version:-
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages. XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) is a stricter, more XML-based version of HTML.

Here are some differences between XHTML and HTML:

1. Syntax: 

HTML allows for unclosed tags, missing attribute quotes, and mixed-case tag and attribute names.
 XHTML requires all tags to be properly closed, attributes to be wrapped in quotes, and all tag and attribute names to be in lowercase.

2. Code Structure:
 
XHTML has a stricter syntax which means that it requires developers to write cleaner, more organized code. 
This can lead to fewer errors, as well as more predictable rendering across different devices and browsers. 

3. Compatibility:

HTML code may be compatible with older browsers, while XHTML may not.
 XHTML can be read by XML parsers, so it works well with other types of software that process XML documents.
In summary,

 while HTML is more forgiving with syntax and compatibility, XHTML enforces stricter coding standards that result in cleaner and more organized code.
* version of html:-
     There have been several versions of HTML, and below are the most popular ones:

1. HTML 1.0 - The initial version of HTML.
2. HTML 2.0 – Introduced some new features, such as forms.
3. HTML 3.2 – Included more structured elements, and was the first version to include CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).
4. HTML 4.01 – Added new features, such as framesets and improved support for scripts and stylesheets.
5. XHTML 1.0 – Was a reformulation of HTML 4.01 in XML syntax, which makes it compatible with other XML-based languages.
6. HTML5 – Introduced new elements, attributes, and capabilities, such as multimedia and interactivity.
* version of xhtml:-
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has published three versions of XHTML: 

1. XHTML 1.0 - It was the first version of XHTML and was published in 2000.
2. XHTML 1.1 - This version fixed some issues of the previous version and added some new features. 
3. XHTML 2.0 - This was a major update from earlier versions and intended to be a clean break from HTML. However, it was eventually scrapped in favor of HTML5.
